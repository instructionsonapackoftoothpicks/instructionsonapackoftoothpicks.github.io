        <h3>Fish Bowl</h3>
        <p>
      
There was only one thing in the room that was different.
<br>For a moment or so he couldn't see what the one  thing  that  was different was, because it too was covered in a film of disgusting dust. Then his eyes caught it and stopped.
<br>It was next to a battered old television on  which  it  was  only possible  to  watch  Open University Study Courses, because if it tried to show anything more exciting it would break down.
<br>It was a box.
<br>Arthur pushed himself up on his elbows and peered at it.
<br>It was a grey box, with a kind of dull lustre to  it.  It  was  a cubic  grey  box,  just over a foot on a side. It was tied with a single grey ribbon, knotted into a neat bow on the top.
<br>He got up, walked over and touched it in  surprise.  Whatever  it was  was  clearly  gift-wrapped,  neatly and beautifully, and was waiting for him to open it.
<br>Cautiously, he picked it up and carried it back to  the  bed.  He brushed  the dust off the top and loosened the ribbon. The top of the box was a lid, with a flap tucked into the body of the box.
<br>He untucked it and looked into the box. In it was a glass  globe, nestling in fine grey tissue paper. He drew it out, carefully. It wasn't a proper globe because it was open at the bottom,  or,  as Arthur realized turning it over, at the top, with a thick rim. It was a bowl. A fish bowl.
<br>It was made of the most wonderful  glass  perfectly  transparent, yet  with  an extraordinary silver-grey quality as if crystal and slate had gone into its making.
<br>Arthur slowly turned it over and over in his hands. It was one of the  most beautiful objects he had ever seen, but he was entirely perplexed by it. He looked into  the  box,  but  other  than  the tissue  paper  there was nothing. On the outside of the box there was nothing.
<br>He turned  the  bowl  round  again.  It  was  wonderful.  It  was exquisite. But it was a fish bowl.
