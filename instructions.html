        <h3>The Instructions</h3>

Wonko the Sane: "I've tried to decorate it  nicely  to  keep  the  inmates happy,  but  there's  very little one can do. I never go in there now myself. If ever I am tempted, which these days I rarely am, I simply look at the sign written over the door and shy away."
<br>"That one?" said Fenchurch, pointing, rather puzzled, at  a  blue plaque with some instructions written on it.
<br>"Yes. They are the words that finally turned me into the hermit I have now become. It was quite sudden. I saw them, and I knew what I had to do."
<br>The sign said:
<br><em>Hold stick near centre of its  length.  Moisten  pointed  end  in mouth.  insert  in tooth space, blunt end next to gum. Use gentle in-out motion.</em>
<br>"It seemed to me," said Wonko the Sane,  "that  any  civilization that  had  so  far  lost  its head as to need to include a set of detailed instructions for use in a packet of toothpicks,  was  no longer a civilization in which I could live and stay sane."
